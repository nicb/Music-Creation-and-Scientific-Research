    \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+->]
        \item Commonplace: it is technology innovation that
								pushes the boundaries of musical expression
        \item This is only partly true
        \item In fact, two processes take place:
            \begin{enumerate}[<+- | alert@+->]
								\item Musicians use technological innovation once
												it is a robust and solid reality and, all in all,
												not in a particularly innovative way
								\item Musicians continuously express requests to technology
												(and -- ultimately -- to science) to be able
												to reach their own expressive and aesthetic objectives
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
