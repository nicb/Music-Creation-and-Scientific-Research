    \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+->]
				\item Music responds to aesthetic imperatives, while science responds
								to rational categories
				\item Generally, music is subject to pressing final deadlines,
								while research cannot, intrisically, guarantee its results
				\item A composer is (generally) an autarchic figure, while research is
								based on cooperation and sharing of results
				\item Every contemporary musical language is strongly characterized
								and specific, while research must adopt universally recognized
								terminologies and notation
        \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle<+- | alert@+->{Parallel Tracks, Environments e Middlemen}

    \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+->]
				\item Music Composition and Scientific Research cannot and must not
								depend strictly on each other: they must travel together on
								parallel tracks and occasionally go out of sync
				\item The perfect setting for a meeting is not the conventional lab:
								it should be a mix between a lab, a studio, and a lounge
				\item It is a setting in which \emph{culture} is created rather than
								\emph{entertainement}
				\item Sometimes the meeting between composers and scientists takes
								place with the help of middlemen -- which ``orchestrate'' the
								actual meeting acting as translators
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+->]
				\item The journey from Music Creation to Technological Innovation
								is still largely unexplored (\emph{implicit} information)
        \item Industry and economy should be concerned with the understanding
								of processes and modalities that may boost the quality of
								innovation (not just incremental innovation, that is)

    \begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+->]
				\item \emph{living labs} which cobble music and research together
								should be widely experimented
				\item conferences, symposia et al. where musicians mingle with
								scientists should be completely refactored
				\item these ``mixed'' communities provide a nice investigation domain
								for modern ethnography
