Musical Creativity and Scientific Research

Music, in spanning a broad range of domains  from  sound  to  sense  and
social interaction, is a major driver for  innovation.  This  innovation
appears both in the theoretical domain where  the  relationship  between
body, mind, and matter is a major issue, and in  the  practical  domain,
where music mediation technology is a major issue.

The idea that music drives innovation rather than vice versa should  not
come as completely unexpected. Music is solidly anchored  to  scientific
foundations and as such it is an epistemological  domain  which  may  be
studied with the required scientific rigour. However, music is  also  an
art and therefore certain ways of dealing  with  music  do  not  require
scientific justification per se because they justify themselves directly
in signification practices. The requirements of musical  expression  can
indeed provide a  formidable  thrust  to  scientific  and  technological
innovation in a much more efficient way than the usual  R&D  cycles  may
ever dream of.

But how does this releationship function in  our  practical  world?  How
does an artistic vision suggest unexplored investigation  domains?  This
lecture  will  propose  several  examples,  illustrate  the  problematic
aspects of the music-science relationship and suggest  some  answers  to
these questions.
